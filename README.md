# spa-react-template

## Overview
This repository is meant to serve as a template for a React enabled SPA webapp.

## Steps for use
1. Create a new repo at [this link](https://github.com/new) from the url of this repo.
2. Clone that repo and run `npm install`
3. Replace all instances of "spa-react-template" with your project name
4. Build the webapp using either `npm run build` or `npm run building`
5. Run `npm run start` to start a local server
6. Modify the website in src/client as desired. Note that you may also have to make some changes to the `base.pug` file
7. When ready to deploy, Google Cloud Run has what I think is the quickest time to deployment. Simply follow the steps at [this link](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-nodejs-service) to deploy.
